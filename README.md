# Vanilla Javascript Projects

## 0-30 // JavaScript30 by Wes Bros

My versions of Wes Bos JavaScript30 challenge! Just clone the repo and get started in the master branch if you want to take the challenge!

I also recommend following [Nitish Dayal's Text Guides](https://github.com/nitishdayal/JavaScript30) as they only describe what you should do without solving it for you.

Grab the course at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com)

## 31-45 // 15 Basic JavaScript Projects by John Smilga

My versions of [John Smilga's JavaScript Basic Projects](https://github.com/john-smilga/javascript-basic-projects)! Just clone the repo and get started in the master branch if you want to take the challenge!

I also recommend watching [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) that clearly solves each one of the basic projects.
