# JavaScript30

My version of Wes Bros JavaScript30 challenge! Just clone the repo and get started in the master branch if you want to take the challenge! 

I also recommend following s * [Nitish Dayal's Text Guides](https://github.com/nitishdayal/JavaScript30) as they only describe what you should do without solving it for you.

Grab the course at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com)
